# libjove

Working GIT of the JOVE (high-performance parallelization of QC calculations through grid quadrature) Project at the Dreuw Group
This library should be stand-alone if armadillo is installed. Use the do_configure script to set up your cmake environment. 

TODOs:
- implement omni-grid class 
- implement simple 3d grid for visualization (?)
- new parallelization scheme
- HPC ready
